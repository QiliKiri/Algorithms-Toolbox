# Algorithms-Toolbox
Those notebooks are my mortified finished assignment on 'Algorithmic Toolbox' which is a course from Coursera.

* ### For all Fibonacci problems (fibonacci_problems file), I add comments to explain the logic behind my codes and help better understanding.
* ### For 'coins_change', I add comments to explain.
* ### For 'fractional_knapsack', I add *many* comments and markdowns to explain the code.

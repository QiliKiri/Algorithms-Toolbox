# Algorithms-Toolbox
Those notebooks are my finished assignment from 'Algorithmic Toolbox' which is a course from Coursera.

* ### For all Fibonacci problems (fibonacci_problems file), I add comments and markdowns to explain the logic behind my codes and help better understanding.
* ### For 'coins_change.ipynb', comments are added to explain.
* ### For 'fractional_knapsack.ipynb', I add *many* comments and markdowns to explain the logic.
